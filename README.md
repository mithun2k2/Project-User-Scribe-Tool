Simple Scribe Tool:
To develop a Simple
Scribe tool using in-built Python string
functions and string manipulation techniques.

Step-by-Step Tasks:
1. String Manipulation: Examples of these include splitting
strings into a character array, checking if a string starts with
or ends with a specific sequence. Splitting a string using
delimiters.
2. Searching & Extracting: Search for specific sub-strings and
extracting these (storing them separately or temporarily).
3. Formatting and Data Cleaning: Standardise strings
(user provided strings or externally sourced) by ensuring
that the format won’t present any issues within code’s
functionality.
4. Applying String Functions: Simply applying the
appropriate string methods/functions to accomplish all of
the above.
Advanced Challenge:
● Allow the user to store their data in a text file.
replace()
split()
lower()
upper()
“x”.join()
find()
