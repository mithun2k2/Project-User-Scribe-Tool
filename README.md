# Project-User-Scribe-Tool
Creating a Simple Scribe tool involves applying various string manipulation techniques to process text input from the user. This tool will allow for basic string manipulations such as formatting, searching, extracting, and storing the processed data in a text file. 

This tool will allow the user to interactively choose what action they want to perform on their input text, including storing the final version in a text file. Each function showcases basic string manipulation techniques that can be further expanded or refined based on specific requirements or user feedback.

Simple Scribe Tool:
To develop a Simple
Scribe tool using in-built Python string
functions and string manipulation techniques.

Step-by-Step Tasks:
1. String Manipulation: Examples of these include splitting
strings into a character array, checking if a string starts with
or ends with a specific sequence. Splitting a string using
delimiters.
2. Searching & Extracting: Search for specific sub-strings and
extracting these (storing them separately or temporarily).
3. Formatting and Data Cleaning: Standardise strings
(user provided strings or externally sourced) by ensuring
that the format won’t present any issues within code’s
functionality.
4. Applying String Functions: Simply applying the
appropriate string methods/functions to accomplish all of
the above.
Advanced Challenge:
● Allow the user to store their data in a text file.
replace()
split()
lower()
upper()
“x”.join()
find()
